> **备注：** This page describes the WebExtensions devtools APIs as they exist in Firefox 54. Although the APIs are based on the [Chrome devtools APIs](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools), there are still many features that are not yet implemented in Firefox, and therefore are not documented here. To see which features are currently missing please see [Limitations of the devtools APIs](/zh-CN/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Using_the_devtools_APIs#Limitations_of_the_devtools_APIs).

The `devtools.inspectedWindow` API lets a devtools extension interact with the window that the developer tools are attached to.

Like all the `devtools` APIs, this API is only available to code running in the document defined in the [devtools_page](/zh-CN/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/devtools_page) manifest.json key, or in other devtools documents created by the extension (such as the document hosted by a panel the extension created). See [Extending the developer tools](/zh-CN/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Extending_the_developer_tools) for more.

## Properties

- [`devtools.inspectedWindow.tabId`](/zh-CN/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/devtools.inspectedWindow/tabId)
  - : The ID of the window that the developer tools are attached to.

## Functions

- [`devtools.inspectedWindow.eval()`](/zh-CN/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/devtools.inspectedWindow/eval)
